# This file is provided to you as a starting point for the "admin.py" program of Assignment 2
# of Programming Principles in Semester 1, 2021.  It aims to give you just enough code to help ensure
# that your program is well structured.  Please use this file as the basis for your assignment work.
# You are not required to reference it.

# The "pass" command tells Python to do nothing.  It is simply a placeholder to ensure that the starter file runs smoothly.
